To do:

Figure out why gmac_debug register is all 0s. Are packets every transmitted at all?a Answer: linux checked, all 0 as well after TX


tx_desc content: DBG[0]: 0x70d00000
tx_desc content: DBG[1]: 0x00000050
tx_desc content: DBG[2]: 0x0011d17c
tx_desc content: DBG[3]: 0x0011d28c


dbg this descriptor setting

1.Need to do a full reg dump of DMAGMAC registers and compare.
2.Need to do a full dump of Struct.

Can pretty sure the problem is in sampling. because register shown successful frame transmission.
Need to figure out how wireshark captures.

check GMAC speed. PS FES TC bits. can check Linux 

if I fprint 109, wireshark is able to detect, 0-108
if I fprint 108, wireshark is not able to detect 0-107

cache coherency issue. Need to figure out cache: no cache issue

20251208:
64byte test frame no cache issue. all sent ok.
greater than 64byte is not able to be sent correctly.
Mile stone:
1.Figure out how to send any length frame. Legal: 64-1518bytes
2.Receive first 64byte frame.
3.Receive any length frame.
4.Implement receive interrupt to automate receive frames.

20251209:
-able to send 112 bytes by changing fixed burst to incr burst. dma_bus_mode.fb=0
-able to send 1518 max non-jumbo frame in one single descriptor
